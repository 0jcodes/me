Statistics are recorded for each player during a match, and aggregated over a career. \r\n                    At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. \r\n                    However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include their Test match statistics – but not vice versa. \r\n                    Nowadays records are also maintained for List A and Twenty20 limited over matches. \r\n                    These matches are normally limited over games played domestically at the national level by leading Test nations. \r\n                    Since one-day internationals are a form of List A limited over matches, a player's List A statistics will include their ODI match statistics – but not vice versa.  \r\n                    We provide the web's most comprehensive collection of cricket records, \r\n                    statistics and graphs relating to every facet of international cricket in all forms - Test Cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20s).\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p>The main idea behind this project was to create a web page to display the above mentioned statistics of every cricket player.\r\n                        These statistics are scraped from the internet and then data cleaning and munging was done so as to use this data for further analysis. \r\n                         The data was further used to display player statistics and his achievements in international cricket. \r\n                    <br></br>They can also be graphically visualised on the webpage.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n

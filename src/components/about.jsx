                 The above quote encapsulates the whole of my personality.
                I am an ambitious computer science student who likes to code,
                I am adept at developing plans and aligning instruction with current learning goals, problem- solver and analytical leader with strong attention to detail and sound judgment focused on continuous improvement.

                Core focuses of interest includes: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics. 
                At present, I have limited experience in these fields but I am very much keen on excelling in these fields and scale to greater heights in the near future.

                  Cricket is a sport that generates a variety of statistics.
                    Statistics are recorded for each player during a match, and aggregated over a career. 
                    At the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, one-day internationals, and first-class cricket are recorded separately. 
                    However, since Test matches are a form of first-class cricket, a player's first-class statistics will include their Test match statistics – but not vice versa. 
                    Nowadays records are also maintained for List A and Twenty20 limited over matches. 
                    These matches are normally limited over games played domestically at the national level by leading Test nations. 
                    Since one-day internationals are a form of List A limited over matches, a player's List A statistics will include their ODI match statistics – but not vice versa.  
                    We provide the web's most comprehensive collection of cricket records, 
                    statistics and graphs relating to every facet of international cricket in all forms - Test Cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20s).
                  </p>
                  <p>The main idea behind this project was to create a web page to display the above mentioned statistics of every cricket player.
                        These statistics are scraped from the internet and then data cleaning and munging was done so as to use this data for further analysis. 
                         The data was further used to display player statistics and his achievements in international cricket. 
                    <br></br>They can also be graphically visualised on the webpage.</p>

                Retail Store Management System is rather a broad definition that can include merchandising aids, displaying inventory 
                and the methods used to enable transactions. Here, we're talking about the hardware and software that allows the admin to monitor the profitability, 
                customer service and efficient operations in his business.  
                </p>
                <p>
                A Retail Store Management System (RSMS) is an application  that  executes  the functions associated with it to perform a single or small set of related tasks assigned by the admin.

              This project is based on Window application program using Java AWT. 
              There are different frames used in this application for holding the main screen, the text area which displays the working of the algorithm, and the combo box and the buttons. 
              Nodes are drawn on the main screen using mouse and then edges are drawn between any two nodes. By default weights are assigned 50 and can be changed. 
              When RUN button is pressed the algorithm runs with a time lag of some specified milliseconds and stops when the distance is calculated from the source node to all other reachable nodes.
              The graph can be further reset or be cleared. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The objective of the project was to use the fundamental concepts of java and also implement some of the features provided by packages to write an efficient code. 
              So, a simple application was developed to demonstrate Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path for directed edges.</p>

                The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document dataset available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is where the name for the dataset comes from, as the Modified NIST or MNIST dataset.
                Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered. This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on the machine learning with very little data cleaning or preparation required.
                Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.    
                It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy.

                PyTorch Framwork was used and both an ANN and a CNN model was created to recognize those digits.

              A blockchain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
              By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
              For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. 
              Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. 
              Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.
